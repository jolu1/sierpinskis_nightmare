You must guide him through several levels where fractal monsters lay in wait. Jump, run, dodge and blast your way through the horrifying hordes to help him escape from his nightmare!

*March 29, 2021 update*: 
The original game was coded in 2011 as a high school project by Mursheed Drahman and me. I'll be uploading this complete version now but some libraries have now been deprecated. I'll work this week on updating the code.
